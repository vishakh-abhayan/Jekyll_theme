With Monophase as a baseline theme for Jekyll, there aren't many options available out of the box. Basic light and dark mode support is included. Colors are also provided for your own customization.

## Dark mode

**Dark mode is enabled automatically** via CSS media queryâ€”you'll find the source code for this in the `_sass/monophase/_variables.scss` stylesheet. If you're familiar with CSS custom properties, you can also use this method to build your own color schemes.

[Read more about using CSS dark mode](https://markdotto.com/2018/11/05/css-dark-mode/) via media queries like this:

```scss
// Example media query to detect dark mode
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  // ...
}
```

## Creating themes

If you want to make your own color schemes, modify the CSS variables in the `_sass/monophase/_variables.scss` stylesheet with a scoped data attribute or class name.

For example, below we've created the beginnings of a blue theme:

```scss
// Example blue theme
[data-theme="blue"] {
  --body-bg: var(--blue);
  --body-color: #fff;
}
```

Then, apply the theme by adding `data-theme="blue"` to the `<html>` element.

## Google Analytics 4

To enable [Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en), you just need to set the [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977?hl=en) in your `_config.yml`, for example,

```yml
google_analytics: G-XXXXXXX
```

## Math

Specify `math: true` on the page where you want to enable MathJax. For example,

```latex
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\mathrm{d}z
```

will be rendered as

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\mathrm{d}z
$$
